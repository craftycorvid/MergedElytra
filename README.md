# Merged Elytra
Server-side vanilla-compatible armored elytra

Like Vanilla Tweaks' Armored Elytra and fully compatible with Armored Elytra created using the datapack.

This is a fork of [Metal Wings by AshyBoxy](https://github.com/AshyBoxy/MetalWings) with added fixes and features.

## Usage
You can combine elytra with a chestplate in an anvil, make sure you put the chestplate in the left slot. You can 
then separate them by putting them in a grindstone. Dropping an armored elytra with a merged netherite chestplate 
into lava will burn the elytra and drop the netherite chestplate.

The mod works perfectly fine server only, but when on the client it'll render both the elytra and chestplate on 
players and armor stands.

If the server is running Vanilla Tweaks' Armored Elytra datapack, installing this mod on your client will render 
the elytra and chestplate.

## TODO
 - Add custom icons for merged elytra on the client

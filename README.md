# Merged Elytra
Server sided, vanilla compatible armored elytra.

Like Vanilla Tweaks' Armored Elytra and fully compatible with Armored Elytra created using the datapack.

This is a fork of [https://github.com/AshyBoxy/MetalWings](Metal Wings by AshyBoxy) with added fixes and features.

## Usage
You can combine elytra with a chestplate in an anvil, make sure you put the chestplate in the left slot. You can 
then separate them by putting them in a grindstone.

The mod works perfectly fine server only, but when on the client it'll render both the elytra and chestplate on 
players and armor stands.

If the server is running Vanilla Tweaks' Armored Elytra datapack, installing this mod on your client will render 
the elytra and chestplate.
